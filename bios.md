# Laura Erban

Laura is a Hydrologist with EPA ORD at the Atlantic Ecology Division. Her mission is to help people use water resources sustainably. Recent work has focused on groundwater: natural and manmade contamination, transboundary overdraft, and pumping-induced land subsidence. These are wicked problems, emerging from complex socio-environmental systems. I believe new modes of systemic thought and practice are needed to address them.

He has a diverse set of skills and interests that include soccer, philosophy, economics, and open source software. Cole lives in Raleigh, NC with his wife and two young children. 

# Tom Purucker

Tom is an ecologist, in EPA/ORD National Exposure Research Laboratory.  His current research involves parameter estimation and model selection for ecological risk assessment algorithms used by the EPA for pesticide registration. A unique aspect to Tom's modelling work is its use of the “cloud” which provides access to the models from a web browser via the übertool, which is an ecological risk web application for pesticide modeling. In addition, Tom teaches introductory courses in biology and statistics at the University of North Georgia.

# Kristen Foley

Kristen Foley is a Research Statistician in EPA/ORD's National Exposure Research Lab and is part of a team that develops the Community Multiscale Air Quality – or “CMAQ” – modeling system. Kristen helps the team evaluate output from CMAQ against different types of air quality measurements. She has been using R since graduate school at NC State and she is always looking to recruit new R users.
